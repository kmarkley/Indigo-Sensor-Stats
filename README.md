## Sensor Stats

Calculates some very basic statistics on a group of sensor values, including mean value, median value, max value, min value, value range, and standard deviation.  

Also compares a single sensor of interest to the group and calculates the variance (to mean), standard deviation, and whether it is currently the maximum or minimum value.

## Dummy Sinewave Sensor

Just what it sounds like.

## Dummy Random Sensor

Ditto.
